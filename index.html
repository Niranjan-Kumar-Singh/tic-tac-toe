            <h2>What is Tic Tac Toe?</h2>
            <p>Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic strategy game played on a 3√ó3 grid. Two
                players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols (X and O), with the goal of being the
                first to achieve three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

            <p>Despite its simple appearance, Tic Tac Toe involves mathematical concepts including game theory,
                combinatorics, and strategic thinking. The game has been studied extensively by mathematicians and
                computer scientists as an example of a solved game with optimal play strategies.</p>

            <h3>Game Objective</h3>
            <p>The primary objective is to be the first player to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row. This can be
                achieved in eight different ways:</p>
            <ul class="game-objectives">
                <li><strong>Horizontal victories:</strong> Three marks across the top, middle, or bottom row</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical victories:</strong> Three marks down the left, center, or right column</li>
                <li><strong>Diagonal victories:</strong> Three marks across either diagonal line</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="strategy-grid">
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h3>üéØ The Center Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Always take the center square (position 5) if it's available on your first move. The center
                        connects to the most winning combinations and gives you maximum control over the game board.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h3>üè∞ Corner Control</h3>
                    <p>If the center is taken, choose a corner square. Corners offer multiple paths to victory and force
                        your opponent into defensive positions more effectively than edge squares.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Block and Attack</h3>
                    <p>Always block your opponent when they have two in a row. Simultaneously, create your own threats
                        by setting up multiple winning possibilities in a single move.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h3>üîÄ Fork Creation</h3>
                    <p>A fork occurs when you have two different ways to win on your next turn. Creating forks forces
                        your opponent to defend against multiple threats, often leading to victory.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Advanced Tactical Concepts</h3>
            <p>Master players understand that perfect play from both sides always results in a draw. However, by
                understanding these advanced concepts, you can capitalize on your opponent's mistakes:</p>

                <p>With perfect play from both players, Tic Tac Toe always ends in a draw. However, if your opponent
                    makes a mistake, you can capitalize and win. The first player has a slight advantage if they play
                    optimally.</p>

                <h3>What's the best opening move?</h3>
                <p>The center square is mathematically the strongest opening move, as it's part of four different
                    winning combinations. Corner squares are the second-best choice, while edge squares are generally
                    weaker.</p>

                <h3>How does your AI work?</h3>
                <p>Our AI uses the minimax algorithm, which evaluates all possible future game states to determine the
                    optimal move. This ensures the AI plays perfectly and never makes strategic errors.</p>
